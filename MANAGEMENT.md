# Managing Team

### At Zealthy, the engineering leadership expectations:
- Leading daily standups
- Code review & pushing to production
- Key technical architecture decision-making
- Interviewing / assessing engineers
- “Checking out” with engineers (will review engineer’s work with them 1x1 before they
leave)

## Philosophy

My management philosophy and style is framed around "Leading daily stand-ups" and "Checking out". I refer to is as "Over explaining", which helps reduce "yesing" and assumptions...

While group discussions are invaluable for saving time and fostering collaboration, assigning tasks through 1-on-1 conversations is crucial. This approach minimizes "yesing", which often stems from people's hesitation to admit they don't fully understand a task or direction in a group setting. Ensuring clarity in 1-on-1 discussions helps avoid misdirection and the need to backtrack later.

Assumptions typically occur when tasks are not explained in detail or when technical terminology is misused or omitted altogether. By providing clear, literal, technical explanations, you can significantly reduce misunderstandings.

In summary, effective communication is the foundation of good management. By focusing on clarity and direct engagement, we can foster a productive, assumption-free production.
